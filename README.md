<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ugo</h1>
<h2 align="center">💻 Software Engineer at <a href="https://github.com/faberNovel" target="_blank">EY Fabernovel</a></h2>
<h3 align="center">I'm a coding monkey 🦍</h3>

<h4>💻 I tend to work on emerging businesses project (like Blockchain or AI).</h4>
<h5><b>Blockchain part</b></h5>
<ul>
<li>I worked on Blockchain projects dealing with <b>Smart contract</b> development using <a>Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://polygon.technology">Polygon</a> environment using <a href="https://soliditylang.org">Solidity</a>. I have deployed several smart contracts to create, manage and publish NFTs associated with 3D Unity assets, it was an art collection linked to physical tracked luxury products.</li>
<li>🌱 Im exploring and learning to <b>create</b>,<b>manage</b> and <b>secure</b>smart contracts. I'm interested in other projects like <a href="https://www.deso.com">Deso</a> protocol and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and cryptographic nerdy stuff like <a href="https://noir-lang.org">Noir-lang</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>AI and Machine Learning</b></h5>
<ul>
<li>For some months now I've worked on image generation, fine-tuning and creating LoRa's for realism fidelity. I managed to serve an image editor for my client allowing him to link Product Asset Manager to the website and ask contextual edits (with Flux Kontext) to modify the image according to prompts.</li>
<li>I am currently focusing on a small project building my own model for French Sign Language (like ASL but in French), my goal is to create a live sign transcriptor.</li>
</ul>

<h4>In general</h4>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects at <a href="https://github.com/EYBlockchain" target="_blank">@EYBlockchain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Fabernovel" target="_blank">@Fabernovel</a> helping clients to bloom with success.

👨‍💻 Most of my projects are privates, but some of them are public.
