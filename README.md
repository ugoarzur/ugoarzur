👋 Hi, I’m @ugoarzur
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain, Web3, NFTs, DAOs and other techy topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to **create**, **manage** and **secure** `smart contracts` with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/fr/), and [Ligo](https://ligolang.org/) on [Tezos](https://tezos.com/).
- I am looking forward to step up on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects at @fabernovel helping clients to bloom with success.
- 📫 How to reach me ? You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArzurUgo).
